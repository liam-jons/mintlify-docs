## Proposal Lifecycle

The proposal system manages the complete lifecycle of business proposals from creation to acceptance:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Draft] --> B[Sent]
    B --> C[Viewed]
    C --> D[Accepted]
    D --> E[Paid]
    B --> F[Expired]
```

## Core Components

### 1. Proposals
The main entity containing:
- Client information (company, email, name)
- Template reference
- Custom content and pricing
- Status tracking
- Expiration date

### 2. Templates
Reusable proposal structures with:
- Predefined sections (tools, flows, prototypes)
- Default pricing structure
- Visual theme configuration
- Active/inactive status

### 3. Access Control
Fine-grained permissions using:
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Role-based access (owner, editor, viewer)
- Time-limited magic links
- Token-based authentication

### 4. Real-time Collaboration
Live features including:
- Proposal updates
- Comment threads
- Status changes
- Analytics events

## Magic Link Flow

The system uses custom magic links for secure, passwordless access:

1. **Generation**: Creator sends proposal via API
2. **Token Creation**: Secure token stored in database
3. **Email Delivery**: SendGrid sends professional email
4. **Authentication**: Token validates and grants access
5. **Session**: Temporary or persistent based on user type
